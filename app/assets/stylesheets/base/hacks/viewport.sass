// Make viewport responsive
//
// @viewport is needed because IE 10+ doesn't honor <meta name="viewport"> in
// some cases. See https://timkadlec.com/2012/10/ie10-snap-mode-and-responsive-design/.
// Eventually @viewport will replace <meta name="viewport">.
//
// However, `device-width` is broken on IE 10 on Windows (Phone) 8,
// (see https://timkadlec.com/2013/01/windows-phone-8-and-device-width/ and https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/10497)
// and the fix for that involves a snippet of JavaScript to sniff the user agent
// and apply some conditional CSS.
//
// See https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-ie10-width for the relevant hack.
//
// Wrap `@viewport` with `@at-root` for when folks do a nested import (e.g.,
// `.class-name { @import "bootstrap"; }`).
@at-root
  @-ms-viewport
    width: device-width

html
  // As a side-effect of setting the @viewport above,
  // IE11 & Edge make the scrollbar overlap the content and automatically hide itself when not in use.
  // Unfortunately, the auto-showing of the scrollbar is sometimes too sensitive,
  // thus making it hard to click on stuff near the right edge of the page.
  // So we add this style to force IE11 & Edge to use a "normal", non-overlapping, non-auto-hiding scrollbar.
  // See https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/18543
